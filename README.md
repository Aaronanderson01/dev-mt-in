# Dev-mt-in

__A note to students and employers__

This is an Intern Project.  What that means is that it is structure to look like what an intern might receive on the job.  You will find in this document:
* Design files of what the project should look like
* Requirements, separated by day, of what the project should be able to do.

That is all.  You will receive no instructions.

Your mentors have been asked to provide only minimal guidance. They can point you in the right direction, but cannot help you code.  Similar to how an intern might receive guidance.  This project is a chance for you to combine and showcase the skills you've learned so far.  

With this guidance only structure we believe this project will showcase what you can do as an individual at this point of the program. 
Because of this we feel this project will be worth putting in your portfolio.

Good luck and work hard!

Sincerely,
Jeremy Robertson
Director, Web @ DevMountain
